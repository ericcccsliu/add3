            In each "round," four numbers will be displayed in four seconds,
            with one number showing every second. The objective is
            straightforward: in add1, you must add 1 to each of the numbers, and
            in add3, you must add 3 to each of the numbers. Calculate your answers in
            modulo base 10â€”that is, adding 1 to 9 yields 0, adding 3 to 8 yields 1, and so on.

            After the numbers display, there will be a second of "rest" time,
            after which you will be able to input your answer. Only one input
            will be allowed every second.
